## Introduction
This is a basic flashcards application which can be played in the command line interface. Users will be prompted with various questions about JavaScript. They can select between multiple choices and will receive feedback about whether their answer was correct or incorrect. The percentage of questions they answered correctly will be displayed at the end once they have answered all questions. The total time it took for the user to go through all of the flashcards will also be displayed at the end.

## Demonstration of Application
